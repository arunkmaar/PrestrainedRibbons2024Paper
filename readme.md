# Supplementary material

- **solvingCrosssectionalDisplacements.nb**: This Mathematica file provides asymptotic solutions for cross-sectional displacements \(u, v, w\).

- **oneDEnergyEquilibriumEqn.nb**: This Mathematica file presents the procedure to arrive at the 1D energy expressions, equilibrium equation, and boundary conditions.

## Auto-07p simulations

This directory contains two subfolders:

- **PreferredLongWavelength**: Contains Auto-07p files and the dependencies for the preferred long wavelength scenario discussed in Section 5.1.

- **PreferredShortWavelength**: Contains Auto-07p simulation files and the dependencies for the short wavelength scenario discussed in Section 5.2.

For explanations on solving equations with Auto-07p and the subsequent post-processing steps, please refer to the `readme.pdf` in `Auto07pImplementation` folder.
